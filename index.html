Hereâ€™s the updated code with 250 slots in the gallery, each linking to an image in an /images subfolder. The src attributes of each image reference a file inside the images/ folder, and the links can be expanded to your detailed pages if needed.

Explanation:

1. Images Array: This array contains 250 image objects. Each object has a name, src, and link. You can easily add more items to this array by following the same pattern.


2. Images Folder: Make sure to place the images in the /images/ subfolder of your project.


3. Detail Pages: For each image, you can create a corresponding detail page (details/image1.html, details/image2.html, etc.) where you add more detailed descriptions.



To Add More Images:

To add more than 250, just continue the pattern of adding entries to the images array.

For each new image, place the image file in the images/ folder and link it accordingly.
